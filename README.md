## Specification

### Caching

The cache needs to be independent of each concurrent instance if possible. This will minimise the amount of space the cache will take so that more things can be cached.

### Defaults

The very basic default menus/systems should be the users, security, tables and menus. This will allow anything else to be added in to the system.
